Layr is a VS Code extension that generates comprehensive, actionable project plans from natural language descriptions. Whether you're starting a new project or planning a feature, Layr helps you think through the architecture, requirements, and implementation steps before you write the first line of code.

   - `gemini` (default) - Google's Gemini AI
   - `openai` - OpenAI's GPT models
   - `claude` - Anthropic's Claude models

**Step 2: Configure API Key**

**For Gemini:**
1. Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Enter your API key in the "Gemini Api Key" field

**For OpenAI:**
1. Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Enter your API key in the "OpenAI Api Key" field
3. Optionally set your organization ID in "OpenAI Organization"

**For Claude:**
1. Get your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Enter your API key in the "Claude Api Key" field

**Step 3: Choose Model (Optional)**
- Gemini Model: `gemini-pro` (default) or `gemini-pro-vision`
- OpenAI Model: `gpt-4` (default), `gpt-4-turbo`, or `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- Claude Model: `claude-3-sonnet` (default), `claude-3-opus`, or `claude-3-haiku`

**Alternative: Environment Variables**
Add to your `.env` file or system environment:
```bash
# Choose one or more based on your preferred provider
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here
```

**Security Note** : API keys are stored locally and never transmitted except to the respective AI provider's API. The extension is configured to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.

## Usage Guide

### Creating a Plan

1. **Open Command Palette** : Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. **Run Command** : Type "Layr: Create Plan" and press Enter
3. **Describe Your Project** : Enter a natural language description of what you want to build
   - Example: "A React todo app with user authentication and real-time updates"
   - Example: "A REST API for a blog platform with user management"
   - Example: "A Python data analysis script for sales reporting"
4. **Review Generated Plan** : The extension will create a new Markdown file with your project plan
5. **Customize as Needed** : Edit the generated plan to match your specific requirements

### Best Practices for Prompts

**Be Specific** : Include technology preferences, key features, and constraints
- Good: "A Node.js REST API with JWT authentication, PostgreSQL database, and Docker deployment"
- Basic: "A web API"

**Mention Context** : Include information about scale, audience, or special requirements
- "A mobile-first React app for small businesses with offline capability"
- "A Python script for processing large CSV files with memory optimization"

**Include Constraints** : Mention any limitations or preferences
- "Using only free/open-source technologies"
- "Must be deployable on AWS Lambda"

## Available Commands

| Command | Description | Shortcut |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `Layr: Create Plan` | Generate a new project plan from description | None |
| `Layr: Execute Plan` | Execute current plan (coming soon) | None |

## Plan Output Structure

Generated plans include:

**Project Overview** : High-level description and objectives
**Requirements** : Functional and technical requirements
**Architecture** : System design and component structure
**Technology Stack** : Recommended tools and frameworks
**Implementation Steps** : Detailed development phases
**File Structure** : Suggested project organization

## AI vs Template Mode

### AI Mode (Gemini)
**Advantages** :
- Highly customized plans based on your specific description
- Considers modern best practices and current technologies
- Adapts to complex or unique project requirements
- Provides detailed explanations and rationale

**Requirements** :
- Internet connection
- Valid Gemini API key
- Google AI Studio account

**Best For** : Complex projects, modern tech stacks, unique requirements

### Template Mode (Offline - currently on testing)
**Advantages** :

- No API key required
- Instant generation
- Consistent structure

**Limitations** :
- Limited to predefined project types
- Less customization
- May not reflect latest technologies

**Best For** : Common project patterns, quick prototyping, offline development

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to generate plan"**
- Check internet connection
- Verify API key is correctly configured
- Try using template mode as fallback

**"API key not found"**
- Ensure API key is set in VS Code settings
- Check that the key is valid and active
- Verify the key has appropriate permissions

**"Extension not responding"**
